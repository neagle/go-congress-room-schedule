Go Congress Room Schedule Generator
===================================

Go Congress has a densely packed schedule of tournaments, lectures, game reviews, and other activities. This script parses a `csv` version of the schedule and generates individual room schedules for each day of the event in PDF form, so they can be printed and posted outside. This makes it much easier for attendees to find the correct room and be confident about what is happening and when.

Usage
-----

```$ npm i
$ npm start --csv <schedule.csv>
```
